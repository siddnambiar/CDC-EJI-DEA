    - **Environmental Justice (EJ):** Fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to environmental laws, regulations, and policies.
    - **Cumulative Impacts:** The combined effects of multiple environmental burdens, social stressors, and existing health conditions that can exacerbate health disparities.
    - **Health Equity:** The attainment of the highest level of health for all people, emphasizing the elimination of health disparities and providing everyone with a fair opportunity to achieve good health.

    - **Health Vulnerability:** Captures pre-existing health conditions that make certain populations more susceptible to environmental stressors.
